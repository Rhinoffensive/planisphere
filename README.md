## Make your own cardboard model planisphere

See https://in-the-sky.org/planisphere/index.php for more information.

To make planisphere models for all latitudes, at five degree intervals, run the shell script `main_planisphere.sh`.

Note that it is not possible to make planispheres for latitudes between 15&deg;N and 15&deg;S, as the celestial pole is too close to the horizon.
